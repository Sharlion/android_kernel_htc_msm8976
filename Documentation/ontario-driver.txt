Ontario Driver --------------

Introduction ------------ This document explains the overview of the
functionality of the Ontario Clock driver.


Ontario Kernel Mode Driver -------------------------- This is a low level
driver which talks to QCom clock kernel mode driver to set the SPI and BUS
clocks needed for QCOM SenseID fingerprint solution. The clock names are listed
in the msm8952.dtsi file.

Ex:
clock-names = "spi_clk", "ahb_clk"; clocks = <&clock_gcc
clk_gcc_blsp2_qup6_spi_apps_clk>,

Rationale --------- The SenseID software is driven over SPI bus from the QCOM
trustzone environment. In order to talk to the HW, SPI need to be configured to
the right configuration which includes voting for the SPI clock and BUS. As the
BUS is shared and vote in trustzone is not aggregated with the other driver
votes on the HLOS, we need to make an explicit vote for the SenseID from the
HLOS whenever the hardware is being used. The solution is a kernel mode driver and
thus the motivation for this driver. Expectation is the application that is using
the SenseID solution need to call into this driver to make required votes.

Interfaces ----------

ontario_ioctl: This is public interface to the applications and supports the
following IOCTLS

ONTARIO_SPI_CLKS_ON: Switches on the clocks and sets the SPI
clock frequency to the value listed in the dtsi file.

ONTARIO_SPI_CLKS_OFF: Switches off the clocks listed in the dtsi file.

Other Functions: ----------------

ClocksOn(): Prepares the clocks, enables and sets the frequency

ClocksOff(): Unprepare the clocks. Refer the clock driver documentation.

ontario_release(): Switches off the clocks specified

ontario_remove(): Switches off the clocks  specified

ontario_suspend(): Switches off the clocks  specified

ontario_resume(): Switches On the clocks  specified

ontario_exit(): Switches off the clocks  specified


Data Structure: ---------------

struct OntarioClk {
  unsigned action; //Set to ONTARIO_SPI_CLKS_ON or ONTARIO_SPI_CLKS_OFF
  unsigned SpiFrequency; // only used with ONTARIO_SPI_CLKS_ON
};
